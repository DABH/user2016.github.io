                  <h2>Conference Registration</h2>
		  <p>Registration for the entire conference takes
		    place at <em>one</em> location,
		    the <a href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/resources/alumnicenter/directions">Arrillaga
		      Alumni Center</a> Lobby on the main Stanford
		    Campus located
		    at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Frances+C.+Arrillaga+Alumni+Center/@37.4309354,-122.1646608,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf1ed37b6739708d4!8m2!3d37.4309354!4d-122.1646608">326
		      Galvez Street, Stanford, CA,
		      94305</a>. Registration will open at 8:00am on
		    Monday, June 27 - Thursday, June 30.</p>

		  <p>As part of
		    the <a href="http://sustainable.stanford.edu">sustainable
		      campus</a> initiative, your conference packet will
		    be minimal. Your badge will have the schedule
		    outline on the
		    back. The <a href="http://schedule.user2016.org">conference
		      program</a> is also designed to be
		    mobile-friendly. A limited number of printed
		    conference schedules will be on hand. You can also
		    print your own copy of the schedule using the
		    print view if you wish. For example, here is a
		    fully <a href="http://schedule.user2016.org/print/all">expanded
		      print out</a>.</p>

		  <h3>Arrive Early/Bring Walking Shoes!</h3>

		  <p>Early arrival will allow time for parking and
		    walking to the venue, picking up your badge and
		    enjoying a coffee or light morning refreshment.</p>

		  <p>Please note that on Monday, June 27, the
		    tutorial day, we make use of two additional
		    venues: <a href="https://music.stanford.edu/venues/campbell/directions-parking">Campbell
		      Rehearsal Hall</a>
		    and <a href="http://wallenberg.stanford.edu/about.html">Wallenberg
		      Hall</a>. These are a 10 - 12 walk from the
		    registration desk where you will need to pick up
		    your badge. Give yourself ample time to
		    walk!</p>

		  <h3>Getting to Stanford from Airport</h3>
		  <p>The <a href="http://visit.stanford.edu/plan/">Visit
		      Stanford</a> site has comprehensive information
		      including public transit. Read on for some quick
		      tips.</p>
		  <p>You can make an online booking for a shuttle such as
		    <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com">Super
		      Shuttle</a>. A shared ride is less than $30 one
		      way, and a ride with a non-stop van (2-3
		      passengers) is about $40. Additional passengers
		      can get on for $10.  Fares may be discounted for
		      round-trip. Please do check these costs yourself.</p>
		  <p>You can also take also a taxi (about $100 one way)
		      or <a href="http://www.uber.com">Uber</a>. Uber
		      has <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/us-california/paloalto/">announced</a>
		      a flat rate of $85 for some peninsula
		      routes.</p>

		  <h4>Driving directions rom Highway 101 North & South</h4>
		  <p>Exit onto Embarcadero Road and travel west,
		  following the signs directing you to Stanford
		  University. About three miles after you exit the
		  freeway, Embarcadero Road becomes Galvez Street as
		  you cross El Camino Real. The Galvez lot is on your
		  right after you go past Arboretum road.</p>

		  <h4>Driving directions from Highway 280 North & South</h4>
		  <p>Exit onto Sand Hill Road and follow the signs
		    for Stanford University. Heading east, drive
		    approximately 3 miles to the Stanford Shopping
		    Center. Turn right onto Arboretum Road (Nordstrom
		    is on your right). Stay on Arboretum until it
		    ends, then turn right onto Galvez Street. The Galvez lot is on your
		    right.</p>

		  <h3>Parking</h3>
		  <p>Attendees who are driving to campus should park
		    in the Galvez Parking Lot. Please see
		    the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galvez+Lot/@37.4335551,-122.1647286,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x742375f8cb520917!8m2!3d37.4335551!4d-122.1647286">parking
		      map</a> for the 3 entry points to the Galvez lot
		    and its location relative to the Arrillaga Alumni
		    Center, where the conference will be held. Note
		    down the stall number where you parked and follow
		    the parking meter instructions. The main choice is
		    between all-day parking and incremental rates, the
		    latter being more appropriate if you arrive after
		    10:45am as no permit is required after 4pm.</p>
		  <p>You will receive a code via email for a special
		    parking rate ($8.00/day) for this
		    conference. Payment is via Visa/MasterCard or
		    exact cash & coins. You do not need to display receipt on
		    dashboard.</p>

		  <h3>Disability Parking</h3>
		  <p>For guests with disabilities,
		    disabled person placards issued by any state are
		    honored in most marked parking spaces on campus,
		    including meters, designated blue spaces
		    (accessible disabled parking is located near all
		    facilities), Service Vehicle spaces and permit
		    lots. State issued disabled placards are not
		    honored in red zones, Resident Fellow (RF) spaces,
		    Special Permit Only or Special Area Permit
		    parking, No Parking areas, or beyond the posted
		    time limit. For additional information, please
		    contact us
		    at <a href="mailto:meetingplanning.stanford.edu">meeting
		      planning</a>.</p>

		  <h2>Navigating the Stanford Campus</h2>
		  <p>Stanford is a rather large campus and it is
		    easy to get lost. Moreover, construction and
		    maintenance work is typically scheduled for the
		    summer and 2016 promises to be as busy as ever,
		    if not more so.</p>
		  <p>A searchable and zoomable campus map
		    is <a href="https://campus-map.stanford.edu/">here</a>. Beware
		    that several buildings share name prefixes but
		    may be quite distant from each other.</p>
		  <p>Signage will identify entrances to buildings
		    used for this conference.</p>

		  <h2>Getting to/from Campus</h2>
		  <p>We have arranged charter shuttles from the
		    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Cardinal+Hotel,+235+Hamilton+Ave,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94301/Arrillaga+Alumni+Center,+Galvez+Street,+Stanford,+CA/@37.4378429,-122.1685908,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fbb3a2f5c4cb1:0xad703eef5fd5c8b9!2m2!1d-122.161131!2d37.444474!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fbb28416493a7:0xf1ed37b6739708d4!2m2!1d-122.1646608!2d37.4309354">Cardinal
		      Hotel at 235 Hamilton Ave, Palo Alto</a> each
		    morning and back at the end of each day. All
		    attendees are welcome to use the charter
		    shuttles. A printed copy of
		    the <a href="files/useR2016-shuttle-schedule.pdf">shuttle
		      schedule</a> might come in handy.</p>

		  <p>Public Transportation is also available to
		    campus from the Palo Alto Transit Center on the
		    free campus Marguerite system on the X and Y
		    lines on Monday thru Friday.  Schedules are
		    available <a href="https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite/schedules.php">online</a>. The
		    Marguerite service is free to all.</p>

		  <p>Staying at a local hotel? Don't forget to ask
		    if they have a complimentary shuttle to
		    campus. If you are staying at
		    the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/stanford+guest+house/Arrillaga+Alumni+Center,+Galvez+Street,+Stanford,+CA/@37.4331508,-122.1989463,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fa4e291132c0d:0x7c8247d8885e6efd!2m2!1d-122.2021949!2d37.4200401!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fbb28416493a7:0xf1ed37b6739708d4!2m2!1d-122.1646608!2d37.4309354">Stanford
		      Guest House located on the SLAC campus</a>,
		    transportation to campus is also available
		    through Stanford's complimentary Marguerite
		    shuttle system. The SLAC line operates between
		    SLAC (with a stop at the entrance to the Guest
		    House) and the Stanford campus, and is available
		    approximately every 20 minute, with less
		    frequent service after 6pm. Last departure is
		    8:05pm. See
		    the <a href="https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite/slac/">SLAC
		      Shuttle Map</a>. The Memorial auditorium stop is
		    closest to the conference venue.</p>

		  <h2>Weather / Attire</h2>
		  <p>The weather for Palo Alto at this time of year
		    is temperate with an average high temperature of
		    80F (27C) and an average low of 54F (12C). As this
		    event will occur both inside an air-conditioned
		    facility and outdoors in the elements, we strongly
		    encourage dressing in layers. We also recommend
		    comfortable walking shoes as there will be some
		    walking and standing outdoors
		    involved. Sunglasses, sunscreen, umbrellas and
		    hats are optional, useful items.</p>

		  <p>Those who plan to take the conference cruise
		    are advised to bring a good jacket; the San
		    Francisco Bay can be windy and cold.</p>

		  <p>We also encourage you to bring your own bag to
		    collect any conference materials or giveaways from
		    the Sponsor Pavilion.</p>

		  <h2>Wireless/Power Access on Campus</h2>
		  <p> You will receive a wireless username and
		    password for use at this conference via
		    email. Follow these instructions. </p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Select the <b>Stanford</b> wireless network from
		      the list of available wireless networks.</li>
		    <li>Select Wireless Guest as the registration choice.</li>
		    <li>Log in with the username and password
		      provided to you in your email from the
		      conference organizers.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>If you have difficulty connecting and need
		    customer support, please contact volunteers on
		    site, or your Housing Front Desk or Conference
		    Planner for assistance.</p>

		  <p>As regards power, it is an immutable fact that
		    there are very few power outlets in the meeting
		    rooms. There will be charging stations located in
		    McCaw Hall. It would be helpful to bring a
		    portable charger for your laptop or phone if you
		    have one.</p>

		  <h2>Conference Banquet Dinner Cruise</h2>

		  <p>For banquet ticketholders, the charter shuttles
		    to San Francisco will depart by 5pm from Lasuen
